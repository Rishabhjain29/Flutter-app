This is a Mobile application to play an age old code breaking game similar to Mastermind.
Flutter is being used to build this application.
I chose Flutter because it allows cross platform programing,
using which we can write a single code for both android and ios.

If you wish to look at the code, you can simply download this package in either
Android Studio or VS-Code. I have used Android studio.

Feel Free to copy and make changes.
